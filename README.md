# Dotfiles

## About
This repository includes a part of my dotfiles to setup my working environments (MacOSX and Debian8 KDE). **This is WIP indefinitely**

If you're interested, just dig in through the repo. 

## Usage
You can even install it on your environment:
``` bash
git clone git://github.com/soifou/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x bootstrap
bash bootstrap -h
```
