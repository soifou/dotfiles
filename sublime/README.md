# Sublime Text

## Overview
This is just my config and packages I use for my working days, so these are very personal choices. Just dig in through the `User` folder to see my settings.

## Installation
Install [Sublime Text 3] then 
``` bash
$ bash bootstrap --sublime
```
Then start Sublime Text and wait for Package Control fetch plugins. It will warn you when it is ready. You may restart once Sublime Text to load all the settings correctly. 

Happy coding!
